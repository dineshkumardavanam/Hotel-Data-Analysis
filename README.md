# Hotel-Data-Analysis


This project entailed the analysis of a sample hotel dataset, incorporating both dimensional (dim) and factorial (fact) tables. The datasets encompassed dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, fact_bookings, and new_data_august. The analytical process unfolded through distinct phases, namely Data Understanding, Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, and culminated in extracting Data Insights.

A comprehensive approach was undertaken, involving meticulous handling of NaN values, the removal of outliers, and the execution of multiple joins utilizing the merge function. Graphical representations were employed judiciously, and significant insights were derived through the systematic analysis of the datasets.
